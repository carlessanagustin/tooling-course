## Linux

1. Linux distribution: There are many different distributions (or "distros") of Linux available, each with its own features and benefits. Popular options include Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian. Investigate and provide references or links of the major distributions. Analise what is the benefits of choosing one over others.

2. Set up a Linux environment: Run a Linux distro on a virtual machine on your computer (recommended) or install it on a separate partition or computer. It's a good idea to set up a dedicated Linux environment for learning and experimentation.
